                In some scenarios, under certain conditions, your application
                might need to refresh ads, sometimes reacting to some user actions
                (for instance when the user browses a photo gallery), or sometimes,
                we'd like to have our app refreshing the ads at a defined time
                interval (forinstance, every 5 minutes).
            </p>
            <p>
                The following example demonstrates how to accomplish refreshable
                ads with react dfp. In this case, we make use of the following
                three pieces:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>- DFPSlotsProvider</strong>: we use it to configure global
                settings (dfp id, etc).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>- AdSlot</strong>: used to define ad slots in your page.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>- DFPManager.refresh()</strong>: after the ads have
                been rendered, we use this method to refresh them at a defined
                time interval.
            </p>
        </Fragment>
    );
}
